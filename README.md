# Digital Encoding Schemes
This program uses 3 digital encoding schemes: Unipolar, NRZ and Manchester to generate waveforms for a given input binary string, simulating bits to digital signal for transmitting data

To run Python, it is recommended to use PyCharm IDE, so installing package will be handled smoothly. However, it is possible to run on terminal by the following commands:
- Install required packages:

`py -m pip install mathplotlib numpy tkinker` or `python3 -m pip install mathplotlib numpy tkinker`
- Run the program:

`py 'Digital Encoding.py'` or `python3 'Digital Encoding.py'`
